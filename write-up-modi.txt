1. This lab took me about 3 hours in total. Activity 1 was fairly simple. It took me some time to understand the difference between the 
basic linkage and multi view handler because the bars looked the same. I spent most of my time understanding the shape genetor acitvity.
2. I really enjoyed this lab because it helped us dynamically use the bar chart to view changes on the scatterplot,(basically linking 2 charts) and this is similar to what 
Ryan and I wanted to do in the Final Project. 
3. The most challenging part was implementing the shape generator activity. It took me some time to figure where to place the jitter function and what it was doing. 
I was also getting errors while adding the jitter function call around the x coordinate in the attribute line. 
4. I used resources to recall how to add an ordinal scale for the difficulty level (Lab 4), understand the configuration settings (config variables) and what they were used for,
.includes function, and add the event listener function, particularly if the filter is active or not. 
I also looked up the d3.dispatch function, d3.stack, and how to implement the click listener events using dispatcher, jitter function, steamgraph, and the different shapes and brushes in d3.
